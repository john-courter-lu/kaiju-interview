# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the necessary dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## The Challenge

See how far you can get! It's not a race though. 

1. "fetch" the kaiju data using `getKaiju`
2. Render a list of all the kaiju's `name`'s
3. Make each rendered kaiju name be a clickable link that opens their `link` url in a different tab
4. Render a "search bar" (text input) above the list
5. Hide the kaiju list until the search bar has any `value`
6. Filter the rendered kaiju list based on the search bar's `value`.
  - Eg: if the value is "ra", then only "Mothra" and "Ghidorah" should appear
