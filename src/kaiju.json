    "ability": "Mothra can fly anywhere from mach 1 to 5 and usually flies around mach 3. Mothra can create powerful wind gusts using her wings. Mothra can drop reflective scales from her wings that act as a 3-D mirror, reflecting opponents' projectile attacks back at them. The scales also have a poisonous effect on enemies. Using the scales diminishes Mothra's flight ability, and for this reason it is usually used as a weapon of last resort. Using the scales diminishes Mothra's flight ability, and for this reason it is usually used as a weapon of last resort. Mothra is an immortal goddess with similarities to a phoenix. Despite having experienced death on multiple occasions, Mothra is always reincarnated through an egg that she lays through divine methods before anything else in her lifetime. Mothra can launch a barrage of poisonous stingers from her thorax.",
